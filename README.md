# Functional Programming in Lean

This repository contains the source code of the book Functional Programming in Lean by David Thrane Christiansen.

The original version of the book was released by Microsoft Corporation in 2023 under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The current version has been modified by the author from the original version to account for changes in newer versions of Lean and to use Verso; these changes are copyright 2023-2025 Lean FRO, LLC. A detailed account of the changes can be found in the book's [source code repository](https://github.com/leanprover/fp-lean/).

Generally speaking, the code in this repository is not intended to work on all computers. The purpose of the repository is to produce the book's HTML for readers. In particular, it probably only works on Unix-like systems, due to the way that the built-in tests exercise the programs built in the book. Building the book requires at least a C compiler available as `cc`, with the POSIX headers, and a Unix-like shell.

To build the book, change to the [`book`](book/) directory and run `lake exe fp-lean`. After this, `book/_out/html-multi` contains a multi-page Web version of the book.
