#doc (Manual) "Indexed Families" =>

Polymorphic inductive types take type arguments.
For instance, {moduleName}`List` takes an argument that determines the type of the entries in the list, and {moduleName}`Except` takes arguments that determine the types of the exceptions or values.
These type arguments, which are the same in every constructor of the datatype, are referred to as _parameters_.

Arguments to inductive types need not be the same in every constructor, however.
Inductive types in which the arguments to the type vary based on the choice of constructor are called _indexed families_, and the arguments that vary are referred to as _indices_.
The “hello world” of indexed families is a type of lists that contains the length of the list in addition to the type of entries, conventionally referred to as “vectors”:

```anchor Vect
inductive Vect (α : Type u) : Nat → Type u where
   | nil : Vect α 0
   | cons : α → Vect α n → Vect α (n + 1)
```

The type of a vector of three {anchorName vect3}`String`s includes the fact that it contains three {anchorName vect3}`String`s:

```anchor vect3
example : Vect String 3 :=
  .cons "one" (.cons "two" (.cons "three" .nil))
```


Function declarations may take some arguments before the colon, indicating that they are available in the entire definition, and some arguments after, indicating a desire to pattern-match on them and define the function case by case.
Inductive datatypes have a similar principle: the argument {anchorName Vect}`α` is named at the top of the datatype declaration, prior to the colon, which indicates that it is a parameter that must be provided as the first argument in all occurrences of {anchorName Vect}`Vect` in the definition, while the {anchorName Vect}`Nat` argument occurs after the colon, indicating that it is an index that may vary.
Indeed, the three occurrences of {anchorName Vect}`Vect` in the {anchorName Vect}`nil` and {anchorName Vect}`cons` constructor declarations consistently provide {anchorName Vect}`α` as the first argument, while the second argument is different in each case.



The declaration of {anchorName Vect}`nil` states that it is a constructor of type {anchorTerm Vect}`Vect α 0`.
This means that using {anchorName nilNotLengthThree}`Vect.nil` in a context expecting a {anchorTerm nilNotLengthThree}`Vect String 3` is a type error, just as {anchorTerm otherEx}`[1, 2, 3]` is a type error in a context that expects a {anchorTerm otherEx}`List String`:
```anchor nilNotLengthThree
example : Vect String 3 := Vect.nil
```
```anchorError nilNotLengthThree
type mismatch
  Vect.nil
has type
  Vect ?m.1606 0 : Type ?u.1605
but is expected to have type
  Vect String 3 : Type
```
The mismatch between {anchorTerm Vect}`0` and {anchorTerm nilNotLengthThree}`3` in this example plays exactly the same role as any other type mismatch, even though {anchorTerm Vect}`0` and {anchorTerm nilNotLengthThree}`3` are not themselves types.
The metavariable in the message can be ignored because its presence indicates that {anchorName otherEx}`Vect.nil` can have any element type.

Indexed families are called _families_ of types because different index values can make different constructors available for use.
In some sense, an indexed family is not a type; rather, it is a collection of related types, and the choice of index values also chooses a type from the collection.
Choosing the index {anchorTerm otherEx}`5` for {anchorName Vect}`Vect` means that only the constructor {anchorName Vect}`cons` is available, and choosing the index {anchorTerm Vect}`0` means that only {anchorName Vect}`nil` is available.

If the index is not yet known (e.g. because it is a variable), then no constructor can be used until it becomes known.
Using {anchorName nilNotLengthN}`n` for the length allows neither {anchorName otherEx}`Vect.nil` nor {anchorName consNotLengthN}`Vect.cons`, because there's no way to know whether the variable {anchorName nilNotLengthN}`n` should stand for a {anchorName Vect}`Nat` that matches {anchorTerm Vect}`0` or {anchorTerm Vect}`n + 1`:
```anchor nilNotLengthN
example : Vect String n := Vect.nil
```
```anchorError nilNotLengthN
type mismatch
  Vect.nil
has type
  Vect ?m.1694 0 : Type ?u.1693
but is expected to have type
  Vect String n : Type
```
```anchor consNotLengthN
example : Vect String n := Vect.cons "Hello" (Vect.cons "world" Vect.nil)
```
```anchorError consNotLengthN
type mismatch
  Vect.cons "Hello" (Vect.cons "world" Vect.nil)
has type
  Vect String (0 + 1 + 1) : Type
but is expected to have type
  Vect String n : Type
```

Having the length of the list as part of its type means that the type becomes more informative.
For example, {anchorName replicateStart}`Vect.replicate` is a function that creates a {anchorName replicateStart}`Vect` with a number of copies of a given value.
The type that says this precisely is:
```anchor replicateStart
def Vect.replicate (n : Nat) (x : α) : Vect α n := _
```
The argument {anchorName replicateStart}`n` appears as the length of the result.
The message associated with the underscore placeholder describes the task at hand:
```anchorError replicateStart
don't know how to synthesize placeholder
context:
α : Type u_1
n : Nat
x : α
⊢ Vect α n
```

When working with indexed families, constructors can only be applied when Lean can see that the constructor's index matches the index in the expected type.
However, neither constructor has an index that matches {anchorName replicateStart}`n`—{anchorName Vect}`nil` matches {anchorName otherEx}`Nat.zero`, and {anchorName Vect}`cons` matches {anchorName otherEx}`Nat.succ`.
Just as in the example type errors, the variable {anchorName Vect}`n` could stand for either, depending on which {anchorName Vect}`Nat` is provided to the function as an argument.
The solution is to use pattern matching to consider both of the possible cases:
```anchor replicateMatchOne
def Vect.replicate (n : Nat) (x : α) : Vect α n :=
  match n with
  | 0 => _
  | k + 1 => _
```
Because {anchorName replicateStart}`n` occurs in the expected type, pattern matching on {anchorName replicateStart}`n` _refines_ the expected type in the two cases of the match.
In the first underscore, the expected type has become {lit}`Vect α 0`:
```anchorError replicateMatchOne
don't know how to synthesize placeholder
context:
α : Type u_1
n : Nat
x : α
⊢ Vect α 0
```
In the second underscore, it has become {lit}`Vect α (k + 1)`:
```anchorError replicateMatchTwo
don't know how to synthesize placeholder
context:
α : Type u_1
n : Nat
x : α
k : Nat
⊢ Vect α (k + 1)
```
When pattern matching refines the type of a program in addition to discovering the structure of a value, it is called _dependent pattern matching_.

The refined type makes it possible to apply the constructors.
The first underscore matches {anchorName otherEx}`Vect.nil`, and the second matches {anchorName consNotLengthN}`Vect.cons`:
```anchor replicateMatchFour
def Vect.replicate (n : Nat) (x : α) : Vect α n :=
  match n with
  | 0 => .nil
  | k + 1 => .cons _ _
```
The first underscore under the {anchorName replicateMatchFour}`.cons` should have type {anchorName replicateMatchFour}`α`.
There is an {anchorName replicateMatchFour}`α` available, namely {anchorName replicateMatchFour}`x`:
```anchorError replicateMatchFour
don't know how to synthesize placeholder
context:
α : Type u_1
n : Nat
x : α
k : Nat
⊢ α
```
The second underscore should be a {lit}`Vect α k`, which can be produced by a recursive call to {anchorName replicate}`replicate`:
```anchorError replicateMatchFive
don't know how to synthesize placeholder
context:
α : Type u_1
n : Nat
x : α
k : Nat
⊢ Vect α k
```
Here is the final definition of {anchorName replicate}`replicate`:

```anchor replicate
def Vect.replicate (n : Nat) (x : α) : Vect α n :=
  match n with
  | 0 => .nil
  | k + 1 => .cons x (replicate k x)
```

In addition to providing assistance while writing the function, the informative type of {anchorName replicate}`Vect.replicate` also allows client code to rule out a number of unexpected functions without having to read the source code.
A version of {anchorName listReplicate}`replicate` for lists could produce a list of the wrong length:

```anchor listReplicate
def List.replicate (n : Nat) (x : α) : List α :=
  match n with
  | 0 => []
  | k + 1 => x :: x :: replicate k x
```
However, making this mistake with {anchorName replicateOops}`Vect.replicate` is a type error:
```anchor replicateOops
def Vect.replicate (n : Nat) (x : α) : Vect α n :=
  match n with
  | 0 => .nil
  | k + 1 => .cons x (.cons x (replicate k x))
```
```anchorError replicateOops
application type mismatch
  cons x (cons x (replicate k x))
argument
  cons x (replicate k x)
has type
  Vect α (k + 1) : Type ?u.2817
but is expected to have type
  Vect α k : Type ?u.2817
```


The function {anchorName otherEx}`List.zip` combines two lists by pairing the first entry in the first list with the first entry in the second list, the second entry in the first list with the second entry in the second list, and so forth.
{anchorName otherEx}`List.zip` can be used to pair the three highest peaks in the US state of Oregon with the three highest peaks in Denmark:
```anchorTerm zip1
["Mount Hood",
 "Mount Jefferson",
 "South Sister"].zip ["Møllehøj", "Yding Skovhøj", "Ejer Bavnehøj"]
```
The result is a list of three pairs:
```anchorTerm zip1
[("Mount Hood", "Møllehøj"),
 ("Mount Jefferson", "Yding Skovhøj"),
 ("South Sister", "Ejer Bavnehøj")]
```
It's somewhat unclear what should happen when the lists have different lengths.
Like many languages, Lean chooses to ignore the extra entries in one of the lists.
For instance, combining the heights of the five highest peaks in Oregon with those of the three highest peaks in Denmark yields three pairs.
In particular,
```anchorTerm zip2
[3428.8, 3201, 3158.5, 3075, 3064].zip [170.86, 170.77, 170.35]
```
evaluates to
```anchorTerm zip2
[(3428.8, 170.86), (3201, 170.77), (3158.5, 170.35)]
```

While this approach is convenient because it always returns an answer, it runs the risk of throwing away data when the lists unintentionally have different lengths.
F# takes a different approach: its version of {fsharp}`List.zip` throws an exception when the lengths don't match, as can be seen in this {lit}`fsi` session:
```fsharp
> List.zip [3428.8; 3201.0; 3158.5; 3075.0; 3064.0] [170.86; 170.77; 170.35];;
```
```fsharpError

```
This avoids accidentally discarding information, but crashing a program comes with its own difficulties.
The Lean equivalent, which would use the {anchorName otherEx}`Option` or {anchorName otherEx}`Except` monads, would introduce a burden that may not be worth the safety.

:::paragraph
Using {anchorName Vect}`Vect`, however, it is possible to write a version of {anchorName VectZip}`zip` with a type that requires that both arguments have the same length:

```anchor VectZip
def Vect.zip : Vect α n → Vect β n → Vect (α × β) n
  | .nil, .nil => .nil
  | .cons x xs, .cons y ys => .cons (x, y) (zip xs ys)
```

This definition only has patterns for the cases where either both arguments are {anchorName otherEx}`Vect.nil` or both arguments are {anchorName consNotLengthN}`Vect.cons`, and Lean accepts the definition without a “missing cases” error like the one that results from a similar definition for {anchorName otherEx}`List`:
```anchor zipMissing
def List.zip : List α → List β → List (α × β)
  | [], [] => []
  | x :: xs, y :: ys => (x, y) :: zip xs ys
```
```anchorError zipMissing
missing cases:
(List.cons _ _), []
[], (List.cons _ _)
```
:::

This is because the constructor used in the first pattern, {anchorName Vect}`nil` or {anchorName Vect}`cons`, _refines_ the type checker's knowledge about the length {anchorName VectZip}`n`.
When the first pattern is {anchorName Vect}`nil`, the type checker can additionally determine that the length was {anchorTerm VectZipLen}`0`, so the only possible choice for the second pattern is {anchorName Vect}`nil`.
Similarly, when the first pattern is {anchorName Vect}`cons`, the type checker can determine that the length was {anchorTerm VectZipLen}`k+1` for some {anchorName VectZipLen}`Nat` {anchorName VectZipLen}`k`, so the only possible choice for the second pattern is {anchorName Vect}`cons`.
Indeed, adding a case that uses {anchorName Vect}`nil` and {anchorName Vect}`cons` together is a type error, because the lengths don't match:
```anchor zipExtraCons
def Vect.zip : Vect α n → Vect β n → Vect (α × β) n
  | .nil, .nil => .nil
  | .nil, .cons y ys => .nil
  | .cons x xs, .cons y ys => .cons (x, y) (zip xs ys)
```
```anchorError zipExtraCons
type mismatch
  Vect.cons y ys
has type
  Vect ?m.5565 (?m.5576 + 1) : Type ?u.5573
but is expected to have type
  Vect β 0 : Type ?u.5440
```
The refinement of the length can be observed by making {anchorName VectZipLen}`n` into an explicit argument:

```anchor VectZipLen
def Vect.zip : (n : Nat) → Vect α n → Vect β n → Vect (α × β) n
  | 0, .nil, .nil => .nil
  | k + 1, .cons x xs, .cons y ys => .cons (x, y) (zip k xs ys)
```

# Exercises

Getting a feel for programming with dependent types requires experience, and the exercises in this section are very important.
For each exercise, try to see which mistakes the type checker can catch, and which ones it can't, by experimenting with the code as you go.
This is also a good way to develop a feel for the error messages.

 * Double-check that {anchorName VectZip}`Vect.zip` gives the right answer when combining the three highest peaks in Oregon with the three highest peaks in Denmark.
   Because {anchorName Vect}`Vect` doesn't have the syntactic sugar that {anchorName otherEx}`List` has, it can be helpful to begin by defining {anchorTerm exerciseDefs}`oregonianPeaks : Vect String 3` and {anchorTerm exerciseDefs}`danishPeaks : Vect String 3`.

 * Define a function {anchorName exerciseDefs}`Vect.map` with type {anchorTerm exerciseDefs}`(α → β) → Vect α n → Vect β n`.

 * Define a function {anchorName exerciseDefs}`Vect.zipWith` that combines the entries in a {anchorName Vect}`Vect` one at a time with a function.
   It should have the type {anchorTerm exerciseDefs}`(α → β → γ) → Vect α n → Vect β n → Vect γ n`.

 * Define a function {anchorName exerciseDefs}`Vect.unzip` that splits a {anchorName Vect}`Vect` of pairs into a pair of {anchorName Vect}`Vect`s. It should have the type {anchorTerm exerciseDefs}`Vect (α × β) n → Vect α n × Vect β n`.

 * Define a function {anchorName exerciseDefs}`Vect.push` that adds an entry to the _end_ of a {anchorName Vect}`Vect`. Its type should be {anchorTerm exerciseDefs}`Vect α n → α → Vect α (n + 1)` and {anchorTerm snocSnowy}`#eval Vect.push (.cons "snowy" .nil) "peaks"` should yield {anchorInfo snocSnowy}`Vect.cons "snowy" (Vect.cons "peaks" (Vect.nil))`.

 * Define a function {anchorName exerciseDefs}`Vect.reverse` that reverses the order of a {anchorName Vect}`Vect`.

 * Define a function {anchorName exerciseDefs}`Vect.drop` with the following type: {anchorTerm exerciseDefs}`(n : Nat) → Vect α (k + n) → Vect α k`.
   Verify that it works by checking that {anchorTerm ejerBavnehoej}`#eval danishPeaks.drop 2` yields {anchorInfo ejerBavnehoej}`Vect.cons "Ejer Bavnehøj" (Vect.nil)`.

 * Define a function {anchorName take}`Vect.take` with type {anchorTerm take}`(n : Nat) → Vect α (k + n) → Vect α n` that returns the first {anchorName take}`n` entries in the {anchorName Vect}`Vect`. Check that it works on an example.
