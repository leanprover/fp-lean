#doc (Manual) "The Universe Design Pattern" =>

In Lean, types such as {anchorTerm sundries}`Type`, {anchorTerm sundries}`Type 3`, and {anchorTerm sundries}`Prop` that classify other types are known as universes.
However, the term _universe_ is also used for a design pattern in which a datatype is used to represent a subset of Lean's types, and a function converts the datatype's constructors into actual types.
The values of this datatype are called _codes_ for their types.

Just like Lean's built-in universes, the universes implemented with this pattern are types that describe some collection of available types, even though the mechanism by which it is done is different.
In Lean, there are types such as {anchorTerm sundries}`Type`, {anchorTerm sundries}`Type 3`, and {anchorTerm sundries}`Prop` that directly describe other types.
This arrangement is referred to as {deftech}_universes à la Russell_.
The user-defined universes described in this section represent all of their types as _data_, and include an explicit function to interpret these codes into actual honest-to-goodness types.
This arrangement is referred to as {deftech}_universes à la Tarski_.
While languages such as Lean that are based on dependent type theory almost always use Russell-style universes, Tarski-style universes are a useful pattern for defining APIs in these languages.

Defining a custom universe makes it possible to carve out a closed collection of types that can be used with an API.
Because the collection of types is closed, recursion over the codes allows programs to work for _any_ type in the universe.
One example of a custom universe has the codes {anchorName NatOrBool}`nat`, standing for {anchorName NatOrBool}`Nat`, and {anchorName NatOrBool}`bool`, standing for {anchorName NatOrBool}`Bool`:

```anchor NatOrBool
inductive NatOrBool where
  | nat | bool

abbrev NatOrBool.asType (code : NatOrBool) : Type :=
  match code with
  | .nat => Nat
  | .bool => Bool
```
Pattern matching on a code allows the type to be refined, just as pattern matching on the constructors of {moduleName (module := Examples.DependentTypes)}`Vect` allows the expected length to be refined.
For instance, a program that deserializes the types in this universe from a string can be written as follows:

```anchor decode
def decode (t : NatOrBool) (input : String) : Option t.asType :=
  match t with
  | .nat => input.toNat?
  | .bool =>
    match input with
    | "true" => some true
    | "false" => some false
    | _ => none
```
Dependent pattern matching on {anchorName decode}`t` allows the expected result type {anchorTerm decode}`t.asType` to be respectively refined to {anchorTerm natOrBoolExamples}`NatOrBool.nat.asType` and {anchorTerm natOrBoolExamples}`NatOrBool.bool.asType`, and these compute to the actual types {anchorName NatOrBool}`Nat` and {anchorName NatOrBool}`Bool`.

Like any other data, codes may be recursive.
The type {anchorName NestedPairs}`NestedPairs` codes for any possible nesting of the pair and natural number types:

```anchor NestedPairs
inductive NestedPairs where
  | nat : NestedPairs
  | pair : NestedPairs → NestedPairs → NestedPairs

abbrev NestedPairs.asType : NestedPairs → Type
  | .nat => Nat
  | .pair t1 t2 => asType t1 × asType t2
```
In this case, the interpretation function {anchorName NestedPairs}`NestedPairs.asType` is recursive.
This means that recursion over codes is required in order to implement {anchorName NestedPairsbeq}`BEq` for the universe:

```anchor NestedPairsbeq
def NestedPairs.beq (t : NestedPairs) (x y : t.asType) : Bool :=
  match t with
  | .nat => x == y
  | .pair t1 t2 => beq t1 x.fst y.fst && beq t2 x.snd y.snd

instance {t : NestedPairs} : BEq t.asType where
  beq x y := t.beq x y
```

Even though every type in the {anchorName beqNoCases}`NestedPairs` universe already has a {anchorName beqNoCases}`BEq` instance, type class search does not automatically check every possible case of a datatype in an instance declaration, because there might be infinitely many such cases, as with {anchorName beqNoCases}`NestedPairs`.
Attempting to appeal directly to the {anchorName beqNoCases}`BEq` instances rather than explaining to Lean how to find them by recursion on the codes results in an error:
```anchor beqNoCases
instance {t : NestedPairs} : BEq t.asType where
  beq x y := x == y
```
```anchorError beqNoCases
failed to synthesize
  BEq t.asType

Hint: Additional diagnostic information may be available using the `set_option diagnostics true` command.
```
The {anchorName beqNoCases}`t` in the error message stands for an unknown value of type {anchorName beqNoCases}`NestedPairs`.

# Type Classes vs Universes

Type classes allow an open-ended collection of types to be used with an API as long as they have implementations of the necessary interfaces.
In most cases, this is preferable.
It is hard to predict all use cases for an API ahead of time, and type classes are a convenient way to allow library code to be used with more types than the original author expected.

A universe à la Tarski, on the other hand, restricts the API to be usable only with a predetermined collection of types.
This is useful in a few situations:
 * When a function should act very differently depending on which type it is passed—it is impossible to pattern match on types themselves, but pattern matching on codes for types is allowed
 * When an external system inherently limits the types of data that may be provided, and extra flexibility is not desired
 * When additional properties of a type are required over and above the implementation of some operations

Type classes are useful in many of the same situations as interfaces in Java or C#, while a universe à la Tarski can be useful in cases where a sealed class might be used, but where an ordinary inductive datatype is not usable.

# A Universe of Finite Types

Restricting the types that can be used with an API to a predetermined collection can enable operations that would be impossible for an open-ended API.
For example, functions can't normally be compared for equality.
Functions should be considered equal when they map the same inputs to the same outputs.
Checking this could take infinite amounts of time, because comparing two functions with type {anchorTerm sundries}`Nat → Bool` would require checking that the functions returned the same {anchorName sundries}`Bool` for each and every {anchorName sundries}`Nat`.

In other words, a function from an infinite type is itself infinite.
Functions can be viewed as tables, and a function whose argument type is infinite requires infinitely many rows to represent each case.
But functions from finite types require only finitely many rows in their tables, making them finite.
Two functions whose argument type is finite can be checked for equality by enumerating all possible arguments, calling the functions on each of them, and then comparing the results.
Checking higher-order functions for equality requires generating all possible functions of a given type, which additionally requires that the return type is finite so that each element of the argument type can be mapped to each element of the return type.
This is not a _fast_ method, but it does complete in finite time.

One way to represent finite types is by a universe:

```anchor Finite
inductive Finite where
  | unit : Finite
  | bool : Finite
  | pair : Finite → Finite → Finite
  | arr : Finite → Finite → Finite

abbrev Finite.asType : Finite → Type
  | .unit => Unit
  | .bool => Bool
  | .pair t1 t2 => asType t1 × asType t2
  | .arr dom cod => asType dom → asType cod
```
In this universe, the constructor {anchorName Finite}`arr` stands for the function type, which is written with an {anchorName Finite}`arr`ow.

:::paragraph
Comparing two values from this universe for equality is almost the same as in the {anchorName NestedPairs}`NestedPairs` universe.
The only important difference is the addition of the case for {anchorName Finite}`arr`, which uses a helper called {anchorName FiniteAll}`Finite.enumerate` to generate every value from the type coded for by {anchorName FiniteBeq}`dom`, checking that the two functions return equal results for every possible input:

```anchor FiniteBeq
def Finite.beq (t : Finite) (x y : t.asType) : Bool :=
  match t with
  | .unit => true
  | .bool => x == y
  | .pair t1 t2 => beq t1 x.fst y.fst && beq t2 x.snd y.snd
  | .arr dom cod =>
    dom.enumerate.all fun arg => beq cod (x arg) (y arg)
```
The standard library function {anchorName sundries}`List.all` checks that the provided function returns {anchorName sundries}`true` on every entry of a list.
This function can be used to compare functions on the Booleans for equality:
```anchor arrBoolBoolEq
#eval Finite.beq (.arr .bool .bool) (fun _ => true) (fun b => b == b)
```
```anchorInfo arrBoolBoolEq
true
```
It can also be used to compare functions from the standard library:
```anchor arrBoolBoolEq2
#eval Finite.beq (.arr .bool .bool) (fun _ => true) not
```
```anchorInfo arrBoolBoolEq2
false
```
It can even compare functions built using tools such as function composition:
```anchor arrBoolBoolEq3
#eval Finite.beq (.arr .bool .bool) id (not ∘ not)
```
```anchorInfo arrBoolBoolEq3
true
```
This is because the {anchorName Finite}`Finite` universe codes for Lean's _actual_ function type, not a special analogue created by the library.
:::

The implementation of {anchorName FiniteAll}`enumerate` is also by recursion on the codes from {anchorName FiniteAll}`Finite`.
```anchor FiniteAll
  def Finite.enumerate (t : Finite) : List t.asType :=
    match t with
    | .unit => [()]
    | .bool => [true, false]
    | .pair t1 t2 => t1.enumerate.product t2.enumerate
    | .arr dom cod => dom.functions cod.enumerate
```
In the case for {anchorName Finite}`Unit`, there is only a single value.
In the case for {anchorName Finite}`Bool`, there are two values to return ({anchorName sundries}`true` and {anchorName sundries}`false`).
In the case for pairs, the result should be the Cartesian product of the values for the type coded for by {anchorName FiniteAll}`t1` and the values for the type coded for by {anchorName FiniteAll}`t2`.
In other words, every value from {anchorName FiniteAll}`dom` should be paired with every value from {anchorName FiniteAll}`cod`.
The helper function {anchorName ListProduct}`List.product` can certainly be written with an ordinary recursive function, but here it is defined using {kw}`for` in the identity monad:

```anchor ListProduct
def List.product (xs : List α) (ys : List β) : List (α × β) := Id.run do
  let mut out : List (α × β) := []
  for x in xs do
    for y in ys do
      out := (x, y) :: out
  pure out.reverse
```
Finally, the case of {anchorName FiniteAll}`Finite.enumerate` for functions delegates to a helper called {anchorName FiniteFunctionSigStart}`Finite.functions` that takes a list of all of the return values to target as an argument.

Generally speaking, generating all of the functions from some finite type to a collection of result values can be thought of as generating the functions' tables.
Each function assigns an output to each input, which means that a given function has $`k` rows in its table when there are $`k` possible arguments.
Because each row of the table could select any of $`n` possible outputs, there are $`n ^ k` potential functions to generate.

Once again, generating the functions from a finite type to some list of values is recursive on the code that describes the finite type:
```anchor FiniteFunctionSigStart
def Finite.functions
    (t : Finite)
    (results : List α) : List (t.asType → α) :=
  match t with
```

The table for functions from {anchorName Finite}`Unit` contains one row, because the function can't pick different results based on which input it is provided.
This means that one function is generated for each potential input.
```anchor FiniteFunctionUnit
| .unit =>
  results.map fun r =>
    fun () => r
```
There are $`n^2` functions from {anchorName sundries}`Bool` when there are $`n` result values, because each individual function of type {anchorTerm sundries}`Bool → α` uses the {anchorName sundries}`Bool` to select between two particular {anchorName sundries}`α`s:
```anchor FiniteFunctionBool
| .bool =>
  (results.product results).map fun (r1, r2) =>
    fun
      | true => r1
      | false => r2
```
Generating the functions from pairs can be achieved by taking advantage of currying.
A function from a pair can be transformed into a function that takes the first element of the pair and returns a function that's waiting for the second element of the pair.
Doing this allows {anchorName FiniteFunctionSigStart}`Finite.functions` to be used recursively in this case:
```anchor FiniteFunctionPair
| .pair t1 t2 =>
  let f1s := t1.functions <| t2.functions results
  f1s.map fun f =>
    fun (x, y) =>
      f x y
```

Generating higher-order functions is a bit of a brain bender.
Each higher-order function takes a function as its argument.
This argument function can be distinguished from other functions based on its input/output behavior.
In general, the higher-order function can apply the argument function to every possible argument, and it can then carry out any possible behavior based on the result of applying the argument function.
This suggests a means of constructing the higher-order functions:
 * Begin with a list of all possible arguments to the function that is itself an argument.
 * For each possible argument, construct all possible behaviors that can result from the observation of applying the argument function to the possible argument. This can be done using {anchorName FiniteFunctionSigStart}`Finite.functions` and recursion over the rest of the possible arguments, because the result of the recursion represents the functions based on the observations of the rest of the possible arguments. {anchorName FiniteFunctionSigStart}`Finite.functions` constructs all the ways of achieving these based on the observation for the current argument.
 * For potential behavior in response to these observations, construct a higher-order function that applies the argument function to the current possible argument. The result of this is then passed to the observation behavior.
 * The base case of the recursion is a higher-order function that observes nothing for each result value—it ignores the argument function and simply returns the result value.

Defining this recursive function directly causes Lean to be unable to prove that the whole function terminates.
However, using a simpler form of recursion called a _right fold_ can be used to make it clear to the termination checker that the function terminates.
A right fold takes three arguments: a step function that combines the head of the list with the result of the recursion over the tail, a default value to return when the list is empty, and the list being processed.
It then analyzes the list, essentially replacing each {lit}`::` in the list with a call to the step function and replacing {lit}`[]` with the default value:

```anchor foldr
def List.foldr (f : α → β → β) (default : β) : List α → β
  | []     => default
  | a :: l => f a (foldr f default l)
```
Finding the sum of the {anchorName sundries}`Nat`s in a list can be done with {anchorName foldrSum}`foldr`:
```anchorEvalSteps foldrSum
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].foldr (· + ·) 0
===>
(1 :: 2 :: 3 :: 4 :: 5 :: []).foldr (· + ·) 0
===>
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 0)
===>
15
```

With {anchorName foldrSum}`foldr`, the higher-order functions can be created as follows:
```anchor FiniteFunctionArr
    | .arr t1 t2 =>
      let args := t1.enumerate
      let base :=
        results.map fun r =>
          fun _ => r
      args.foldr
        (fun arg rest =>
          (t2.functions rest).map fun more =>
            fun f => more (f arg) f)
        base
```
The complete definition of {anchorName FiniteFunctions}`Finite.functions` is:
```anchor FiniteFunctions
def Finite.functions
    (t : Finite)
    (results : List α) : List (t.asType → α) :=
  match t with
| .unit =>
  results.map fun r =>
    fun () => r
| .bool =>
  (results.product results).map fun (r1, r2) =>
    fun
      | true => r1
      | false => r2
| .pair t1 t2 =>
  let f1s := t1.functions <| t2.functions results
  f1s.map fun f =>
    fun (x, y) =>
      f x y
    | .arr t1 t2 =>
      let args := t1.enumerate
      let base :=
        results.map fun r =>
          fun _ => r
      args.foldr
        (fun arg rest =>
          (t2.functions rest).map fun more =>
            fun f => more (f arg) f)
        base
```



Because {anchorName MutualStart}`Finite.enumerate` and {anchorName FiniteFunctions}`Finite.functions` call each other, they must be defined in a {kw}`mutual` block.
In other words, right before the definition of {anchorName MutualStart}`Finite.enumerate` is the {kw}`mutual` keyword:
```anchor MutualStart
mutual
  def Finite.enumerate (t : Finite) : List t.asType :=
    match t with
```
and right after the definition of {anchorName FiniteFunctions}`Finite.functions` is the {kw}`end` keyword:
```anchor MutualEnd
    | .arr t1 t2 =>
      let args := t1.enumerate
      let base :=
        results.map fun r =>
          fun _ => r
      args.foldr
        (fun arg rest =>
          (t2.functions rest).map fun more =>
            fun f => more (f arg) f)
        base
end
```

This algorithm for comparing functions is not particularly practical.
The number of cases to check grows exponentially; even a simple type like {anchorTerm lots}`((Bool × Bool) → Bool) → Bool` describes {anchorInfoText nestedFunLength}`65536` distinct functions.
Why are there so many?
Based on the reasoning above, and using $`\left| T \right|` to represent the number of values described by the type $`T`, we should expect that
$$`\left| \left( \left( \mathtt{Bool} \times \mathtt{Bool} \right) \rightarrow \mathtt{Bool} \right) \rightarrow \mathtt{Bool} \right|`
is
$$`\left|\mathrm{Bool}\right|^{\left| \left( \mathtt{Bool} \times \mathtt{Bool} \right) \rightarrow \mathtt{Bool} \right| },`
which is
$$`2^{2^{\left| \mathtt{Bool} \times \mathtt{Bool} \right| }},`
which is
$$`2^{2^4}`
or 65536.
Nested exponentials grow quickly, and there are many higher-order functions.
