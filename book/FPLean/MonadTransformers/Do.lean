#doc (Manual) "More do Features" =>

Lean's {kw}`do`-notation provides a syntax for writing programs with monads that resembles imperative programming languages.
In addition to providing a convenient syntax for programs with monads, {kw}`do`-notation provides syntax for using certain monad transformers.

# Single-Branched {kw}`if`

When working in a monad, a common pattern is to carry out a side effect only if some condition is true.
For instance, {anchorName countLettersModify (module := Examples.MonadTransformers.Defs)}`countLetters` contains a check for vowels or consonants, and letters that are neither have no effect on the state.
This is captured by having the {kw}`else` branch evaluate to {anchorTerm countLettersModify (module := Examples.MonadTransformers.Defs)}`pure ()`, which has no effects:

```anchor countLettersModify (module := Examples.MonadTransformers.Defs)
def countLetters (str : String) : StateT LetterCounts (Except Err) Unit :=
  let rec loop (chars : List Char) := do
    match chars with
    | [] => pure ()
    | c :: cs =>
      if c.isAlpha then
        if vowels.contains c then
          modify fun st => {st with vowels := st.vowels + 1}
        else if consonants.contains c then
          modify fun st => {st with consonants := st.consonants + 1}
        else -- modified or non-English letter
          pure ()
      else throw (.notALetter c)
      loop cs
  loop str.toList
```

When an {kw}`if` is a statement in a {kw}`do`-block, rather than being an expression, then {anchorTerm countLettersModify (module:=Examples.MonadTransformers.Defs)}`else pure ()` can simply be omitted, and Lean inserts it automatically.
The following definition of {anchorName countLettersNoElse}`countLetters` is completely equivalent:

```anchor countLettersNoElse
def countLetters (str : String) : StateT LetterCounts (Except Err) Unit :=
  let rec loop (chars : List Char) := do
    match chars with
    | [] => pure ()
    | c :: cs =>
      if c.isAlpha then
        if vowels.contains c then
          modify fun st => {st with vowels := st.vowels + 1}
        else if consonants.contains c then
          modify fun st => {st with consonants := st.consonants + 1}
      else throw (.notALetter c)
      loop cs
  loop str.toList
```
A program that uses a state monad to count the entries in a list that satisfy some monadic check can be written as follows:

```anchor count
def count [Monad m] [MonadState Nat m] (p : α → m Bool) : List α → m Unit
  | [] => pure ()
  | x :: xs => do
    if ← p x then
      modify (· + 1)
    count p xs
```

Similarly, {lit}`if not E1 then STMT...` can instead be written {lit}`unless E1 do STMT...`.
The converse of {anchorName count}`count` that counts entries that don't satisfy the monadic check can be written by replacing {kw}`if` with {kw}`unless`:

```anchor countNot
def countNot [Monad m] [MonadState Nat m] (p : α → m Bool) : List α → m Unit
  | [] => pure ()
  | x :: xs => do
    unless ← p x do
      modify (· + 1)
    countNot p xs
```

Understanding single-branched {kw}`if` and {kw}`unless` does not require thinking about monad transformers.
They simply replace the missing branch with {anchorTerm count}`pure ()`.
The remaining extensions in this section, however, require Lean to automatically rewrite the {kw}`do`-block to add a local transformer on top of the monad that the {kw}`do`-block is written in.

# Early Return

The standard library contains a function {anchorName findHuh}`List.find?` that returns the first entry in a list that satisfies some check.
A simple implementation that doesn't make use of the fact that {anchorName findHuh}`Option` is a monad loops over the list using a recursive function, with an {kw}`if` to stop the loop when the desired entry is found:

```anchor findHuhSimple
def List.find? (p : α → Bool) : List α → Option α
  | [] => none
  | x :: xs =>
    if p x then
      some x
    else
      find? p xs
```

Imperative languages typically sport the {kw}`return` keyword that aborts the execution of a function, immediately returning some value to the caller.
In Lean, this is available in {kw}`do`-notation, and {kw}`return` halts the execution of a {kw}`do`-block, with {kw}`return`'s argument being the value returned from the monad.
In other words, {anchorName findHuhFancy}`List.find?` could have been written like this:

```anchor findHuhFancy
def List.find? (p : α → Bool) : List α → Option α
  | [] => failure
  | x :: xs => do
    if p x then return x
    find? p xs
```

Early return in imperative languages is a bit like an exception that can only cause the current stack frame to be unwound.
Both early return and exceptions terminate execution of a block of code, effectively replacing the surrounding code with the thrown value.
Behind the scenes, early return in Lean is implemented using a version of {anchorName runCatch}`ExceptT`.
Each {kw}`do`-block that uses early return is wrapped in an exception handler (in the sense of the function {anchorName MonadExcept (module:=Examples.MonadTransformers.Defs)}`tryCatch`).
Early returns are translated to throwing the value as an exception, and the handlers catch the thrown value and return it immediately.
In other words, the {kw}`do`-block's original return value type is also used as the exception type.

Making this more concrete, the helper function {anchorName runCatch}`runCatch` strips a layer of {anchorName runCatch}`ExceptT` from the top of a monad transformer stack when the exception type and return type are the same:

```anchor runCatch
def runCatch [Monad m] (action : ExceptT α m α) : m α := do
  match ← action with
  | Except.ok x => pure x
  | Except.error x => pure x
```
The {kw}`do`-block in {anchorName findHuh}`List.find?` that uses early return is translated to a {kw}`do`-block that does not use early return by wrapping it in a use of {anchorName desugaredFindHuh}`runCatch`, and replacing early returns with {anchorName desugaredFindHuh}`throw`:

```anchor desugaredFindHuh
def List.find? (p : α → Bool) : List α → Option α
  | [] => failure
  | x :: xs =>
    runCatch do
      if p x then throw x else pure ()
      monadLift (find? p xs)
```

Another situation in which early return is useful is command-line applications that terminate early if the arguments or input are incorrect.
Many programs begin with a section that validates arguments and inputs before proceeding to the main body of the program.
The following version of {ref "running-a-program"}[the greeting program {lit}`hello-name`] checks that no command-line arguments were provided:
```anchor main (module := EarlyReturn)
def main (argv : List String) : IO UInt32 := do
  let stdin ← IO.getStdin
  let stdout ← IO.getStdout
  let stderr ← IO.getStderr

  unless argv == [] do
    stderr.putStrLn s!"Expected no arguments, but got {argv.length}"
    return 1

  stdout.putStrLn "How would you like to be addressed?"
  stdout.flush

  let name := (← stdin.getLine).trim
  if name == "" then
    stderr.putStrLn s!"No name provided"
    return 1

  stdout.putStrLn s!"Hello, {name}!"

  return 0
```
Running it with no arguments and typing the name {lit}`David` yields the same result as the previous version:
```commands «early-return» "early-return"
$ expect -f ./run # lean --run EarlyReturn.lean
How would you like to be addressed?
David
Hello, David!
```

Providing the name as a command-line argument instead of an answer causes an error:
```commands «early-return» "early-return"
$ expect -f ./too-many-args # lean --run EarlyReturn.lean David
Expected no arguments, but got 1
```

And providing no name causes the other error:
```commands «early-return» "early-return"
$ expect -f ./no-name # lean --run EarlyReturn.lean
How would you like to be addressed?

No name provided
```

The program that uses early return avoids needing to nest the control flow, as is done in this version that does not use early return:
```anchor nestedmain (module := EarlyReturn)
def main (argv : List String) : IO UInt32 := do
  let stdin ← IO.getStdin
  let stdout ← IO.getStdout
  let stderr ← IO.getStderr

  if argv != [] then
    stderr.putStrLn s!"Expected no arguments, but got {argv.length}"
    pure 1
  else
    stdout.putStrLn "How would you like to be addressed?"
    stdout.flush

    let name := (← stdin.getLine).trim
    if name == "" then
      stderr.putStrLn s!"No name provided"
      pure 1
    else
      stdout.putStrLn s!"Hello, {name}!"
      pure 0
```

One important difference between early return in Lean and early return in imperative languages is that Lean's early return applies only to the current {kw}`do`-block.
When the entire definition of a function is in the same {kw}`do` block, this difference doesn't matter.
But if {kw}`do` occurs underneath some other structures, then the difference becomes apparent.
For example, given the following definition of {anchorName greet}`greet`:

```anchor greet
def greet (name : String) : String :=
  "Hello, " ++ Id.run do return name
```
the expression {anchorTerm greetDavid}`greet "David"` evaluates to {anchorTerm greetDavid}`"Hello, David"`, not just {anchorTerm greetDavid}`"David"`.

# Loops

Just as every program with mutable state can be rewritten to a program that passes the state as arguments, every loop can be rewritten as a recursive function.
From one perspective, {anchorName findHuh}`List.find?` is most clear as a recursive function.
After all, its definition mirrors the structure of the list: if the head passes the check, then it should be returned; otherwise look in the tail.
When no more entries remain, the answer is {anchorName findHuhSimple}`none`.
From another perspective, {anchorName findHuh}`List.find?` is most clear as a loop.
After all, the program consults the entries in order until a satisfactory one is found, at which point it terminates.
If the loop terminates without having returned, the answer is {anchorName findHuhSimple}`none`.

## Looping with ForM

Lean includes a type class that describes looping over a container type in some monad.
This class is called {anchorName ForM}`ForM`:

```anchor ForM
class ForM (m : Type u → Type v) (γ : Type w₁)
    (α : outParam (Type w₂)) where
  forM [Monad m] : γ → (α → m PUnit) → m PUnit
```
This class is quite general.
The parameter {anchorName ForM}`m` is a monad with some desired effects, {anchorName ForM}`γ` is the collection to be looped over, and {anchorName ForM}`α` is the type of elements from the collection.
Typically, {anchorName ForM}`m` is allowed to be any monad, but it is possible to have a data structure that e.g. only supports looping in {anchorName printArray}`IO`.
The method {anchorName ForM}`forM` takes a collection, a monadic action to be run for its effects on each element from the collection, and is then responsible for running the actions.

The instance for {anchorName ListForM}`List` allows {anchorName ListForM}`m` to be any monad, it sets {anchorName ForM}`γ` to be {anchorTerm ListForM}`List α`, and sets the class's {anchorName ForM}`α` to be the same {anchorName ListForM}`α` found in the list:

```anchor ListForM
def List.forM [Monad m] : List α → (α → m PUnit) → m PUnit
  | [], _ => pure ()
  | x :: xs, action => do
    action x
    forM xs action

instance : ForM m (List α) α where
  forM := List.forM
```
The {ref "reader-io-implementation"}[function {anchorName doList (module := DirTree)}`doList` from {lit}`doug`] is {anchorName ForM}`forM` for lists.
Because {anchorName countLettersForM}`forM` is intended to be used in {kw}`do`-blocks, it uses {anchorName ForM}`Monad` rather than {anchorName OptionTExec}`Applicative`.
{anchorName ForM}`forM` can be used to make {anchorName countLettersForM}`countLetters` much shorter:

```anchor countLettersForM
def countLetters (str : String) : StateT LetterCounts (Except Err) Unit :=
  forM str.toList fun c => do
    if c.isAlpha then
      if vowels.contains c then
        modify fun st => {st with vowels := st.vowels + 1}
      else if consonants.contains c then
        modify fun st => {st with consonants := st.consonants + 1}
    else throw (.notALetter c)
```


The instance for {anchorName ManyForM}`Many` is very similar:

```anchor ManyForM
def Many.forM [Monad m] : Many α → (α → m PUnit) → m PUnit
  | Many.none, _ => pure ()
  | Many.more first rest, action => do
    action first
    forM (rest ()) action

instance : ForM m (Many α) α where
  forM := Many.forM
```

Because {anchorName ForM}`γ` can be any type at all, {anchorName ForM}`ForM` can support non-polymorphic collections.
A very simple collection is one of the natural numbers less than some given number, in reverse order:

```anchor AllLessThan
structure AllLessThan where
  num : Nat
```
Its {anchorName ForM}`ForM` operator applies the provided action to each smaller {anchorName ListCount}`Nat`:

```anchor AllLessThanForM
def AllLessThan.forM [Monad m]
    (coll : AllLessThan) (action : Nat → m Unit) :
    m Unit :=
  let rec countdown : Nat → m Unit
    | 0 => pure ()
    | n + 1 => do
      action n
      countdown n
  countdown coll.num

instance : ForM m AllLessThan Nat where
  forM := AllLessThan.forM
```
Running {anchorName AllLessThanForMRun}`IO.println` on each number less than five can be accomplished with {anchorName ForM}`ForM`:
```anchor AllLessThanForMRun
#eval forM { num := 5 : AllLessThan } IO.println
```
```anchorInfo AllLessThanForMRun
4
3
2
1
0
```

An example {anchorName ForM}`ForM` instance that works only in a particular monad is one that loops over the lines read from an IO stream, such as standard input:
```anchor LinesOf (module := ForMIO)
structure LinesOf where
  stream : IO.FS.Stream

partial def LinesOf.forM
    (readFrom : LinesOf) (action : String → IO Unit) :
    IO Unit := do
  let line ← readFrom.stream.getLine
  if line == "" then return ()
  action line
  forM readFrom action

instance : ForM IO LinesOf String where
  forM := LinesOf.forM
```
The definition of {anchorName ForM}`ForM` is marked {kw}`partial` because there is no guarantee that the stream is finite.
In this case, {anchorName ranges}`IO.FS.Stream.getLine` works only in the {anchorName countToThree}`IO` monad, so no other monad can be used for looping.

This example program uses this looping construct to filter out lines that don't contain letters:
```anchor main (module := ForMIO)
def main (argv : List String) : IO UInt32 := do
  if argv != [] then
    IO.eprintln "Unexpected arguments"
    return 1

  forM (LinesOf.mk (← IO.getStdin)) fun line => do
    if line.any (·.isAlpha) then
      IO.print line

  return 0
```
```commands formio "formio" (show := false)
$ ls
expected
test-data
$ cp ../ForMIO.lean .
$ ls
ForMIO.lean
expected
test-data
```
The file {lit}`test-data` contains:
```file formio "formio/test-data"
Hello!
!!!!!
12345
abc123

Ok
```
Invoking this program, which is stored in {lit}`ForMIO.lean`, yields the following output:
```commands formio "formio"
$ lean --run ForMIO.lean < test-data
Hello!
abc123
Ok
```

## Stopping Iteration

Terminating a loop early is difficult to do with {anchorName ForM}`ForM`.
Writing a function that iterates over the {anchorName AllLessThan}`Nat`s in an {anchorName AllLessThan}`AllLessThan` only until {anchorTerm OptionTcountToThree}`3` is reached requires a means of stopping the loop partway through.
One way to achieve this is to use {anchorName ForM}`ForM` with the {anchorName OptionTExec}`OptionT` monad transformer.
The first step is to define {anchorName OptionTExec}`OptionT.exec`, which discards information about both the return value and whether or not the transformed computation succeeded:

```anchor OptionTExec
def OptionT.exec [Applicative m] (action : OptionT m α) : m Unit :=
  action *> pure ()
```
Then, failure in the {anchorName OptionTExec}`OptionT` instance of {anchorName AlternativeOptionT (module:=Examples.MonadTransformers.Defs)}`Alternative` can be used to terminate looping early:

```anchor OptionTcountToThree
def countToThree (n : Nat) : IO Unit :=
  let nums : AllLessThan := ⟨n⟩
  OptionT.exec (forM nums fun i => do
    if i < 3 then failure else IO.println i)
```
A quick test demonstrates that this solution works:
```anchor optionTCountSeven
#eval countToThree 7
```
```anchorInfo optionTCountSeven
6
5
4
3
```

However, this code is not so easy to read.
Terminating a loop early is a common task, and Lean provides more syntactic sugar to make this easier.
This same function can also be written as follows:

```anchor countToThree
def countToThree (n : Nat) : IO Unit := do
  let nums : AllLessThan := ⟨n⟩
  for i in nums do
    if i < 3 then break
    IO.println i
```
Testing it reveals that it works just like the prior version:
```anchor countSevenFor
#eval countToThree 7
```
```anchorInfo countSevenFor
6
5
4
3
```

The {kw}`for`{lit}` ...`{kw}`in`{lit}` ...`{kw}`do`{lit}` ...` syntax desugars to the use of a type class called {anchorName ForInIOAllLessThan}`ForIn`, which is a somewhat more complicated version of {anchorName ForM}`ForM` that keeps track of state and early termination.
The standard library provides an adapter that converts a {anchorName ForM}`ForM` instance into a {anchorName ForInIOAllLessThan}`ForIn` instance, called {anchorName ForInIOAllLessThan}`ForM.forIn`.
To enable {kw}`for` loops based on a {anchorName ForM}`ForM` instance, add something like the following, with appropriate replacements for {anchorName AllLessThan}`AllLessThan` and {anchorName AllLessThan}`Nat`:

```anchor ForInIOAllLessThan
instance : ForIn m AllLessThan Nat where
  forIn := ForM.forIn
```
Note, however, that this adapter only works for {anchorName ForM}`ForM` instances that keep the monad unconstrained, as most of them do.
This is because the adapter uses {anchorName SomeMonads (module:=Examples.MonadTransformers.Defs)}`StateT` and {anchorName SomeMonads (module:=Examples.MonadTransformers.Defs)}`ExceptT`, rather than the underlying monad.

Early return is supported in {kw}`for` loops.
The translation of {kw}`do` blocks with early return into a use of an exception monad transformer applies equally well underneath {anchorName ForM}`ForM` as the earlier use of {anchorName OptionTExec}`OptionT` to halt iteration does.
This version of {anchorName findHuh}`List.find?` makes use of both:

```anchor findHuh
def List.find? (p : α → Bool) (xs : List α) : Option α := do
  for x in xs do
    if p x then return x
  failure
```

In addition to {kw}`break`, {kw}`for` loops support {kw}`continue` to skip the rest of the loop body in an iteration.
An alternative (but confusing) formulation of {anchorName findHuhCont}`List.find?` skips elements that don't satisfy the check:

```anchor findHuhCont
def List.find? (p : α → Bool) (xs : List α) : Option α := do
  for x in xs do
    if not (p x) then continue
    return x
  failure
```

A {anchorName ranges}`Std.Range` is a structure that consists of a starting number, an ending number, and a step.
They represent a sequence of natural numbers, from the starting number to the ending number, increasing by the step each time.
Lean has special syntax to construct ranges, consisting of square brackets, numbers, and colons that comes in four varieties.
The stopping point must always be provided, while the start and the step are optional, defaulting to {anchorTerm ranges}`0` and {anchorTerm ranges}`1`, respectively:

:::table +header
*
 *  Expression
 *  Start
 *  Stop
 *  Step
 *  As List

*
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStopContents}`[:10]`
 *  {anchorTerm ranges}`0`
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStop}`10`
 *  {anchorTerm ranges}`1`
 *  {anchorInfo rangeStopContents}`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

*
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStartStopContents}`[2:10]`
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStartStopContents}`2`
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStartStopContents}`10`
 *  {anchorTerm ranges}`1`
 *  {anchorInfo rangeStartStopContents}`[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

*
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStopStepContents}`[:10:3]`
 *  {anchorTerm ranges}`0`
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStartStopContents}`10`
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStopStepContents}`3`
 *  {anchorInfo rangeStopStepContents}`[0, 3, 6, 9]`

*
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStartStopStepContents}`[2:10:3]`
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStartStopStepContents}`2`
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStartStopStepContents}`10`
 *  {anchorTerm rangeStartStopStepContents}`3`
 *  {anchorInfo rangeStartStopStepContents}`[2, 5, 8]`

:::

Note that the starting number _is_ included in the range, while the stopping numbers is not.
All three arguments are {anchorName three}`Nat`s, which means that ranges cannot count down—a range where the starting number is greater than or equal to the stopping number simply contains no numbers.

Ranges can be used with {kw}`for` loops to draw numbers from the range.
This program counts even numbers from four to eight:

```anchor fourToEight
def fourToEight : IO Unit := do
  for i in [4:9:2] do
    IO.println i
```
Running it yields:
```anchorInfo fourToEightOut
4
6
8
```


Finally, {kw}`for` loops support iterating over multiple collections in parallel, by separating the {kw}`in` clauses with commas.
Looping halts when the first collection runs out of elements, so the declaration:

```anchor parallelLoop
def parallelLoop := do
  for x in ["currant", "gooseberry", "rowan"], y in [4:8] do
    IO.println (x, y)
```
produces three lines of output:
```anchor parallelLoopOut
#eval parallelLoop
```
```anchorInfo parallelLoopOut
(currant, 4)
(gooseberry, 5)
(rowan, 6)
```

Many data structures implement an enhanced version of the {anchorName ForInIOAllLessThan}`ForIn` type class that adds evidence that the element was drawn from the collection to the loop body.
These can be used by providing a name for the evidence prior to the name of the element.
This function prints all the elements of an array together with their indices, and the compiler is able to determine that the array lookups are all safe due to the evidence {anchorName printArray}`h`:

```anchor printArray
def printArray [ToString α] (xs : Array α) : IO Unit := do
  for h : i in [0:xs.size] do
    IO.println s!"{i}:\t{xs[i]}"
```
In this example, {anchorName printArray}`h` is evidence that {lit}`i ∈ [0:xs.size]`, and the tactic that checks whether {anchorTerm printArray}`xs[i]` is safe is able to transform this into evidence that {lit}`i < xs.size`.

# Mutable Variables

In addition to early {kw}`return`, {kw}`else`-less {kw}`if`, and {kw}`for` loops, Lean supports local mutable variables within a {kw}`do` block.
Behind the scenes, these mutable variables desugar to code that's equivalent to {anchorName twoStateT}`StateT`, rather than being implemented by true mutable variables.
Once again, functional programming is used to simulate imperative programming.

A local mutable variable is introduced with {kw}`let mut` instead of plain {kw}`let`.
The definition {anchorName two}`two`, which uses the identity monad {anchorName sameBlock}`Id` to enable {kw}`do`-syntax without introducing any effects, counts to {anchorTerm ranges}`2`:

```anchor two
def two : Nat := Id.run do
  let mut x := 0
  x := x + 1
  x := x + 1
  return x
```
This code is equivalent to a definition that uses {anchorName twoStateT}`StateT` to add {anchorTerm twoStateT}`1` twice:

```anchor twoStateT
def two : Nat :=
  let block : StateT Nat Id Nat := do
    modify (· + 1)
    modify (· + 1)
    return (← get)
  let (result, _finalState) := block 0
  result
```

Local mutable variables work well with all the other features of {kw}`do`-notation that provide convenient syntax for monad transformers.
The definition {anchorName three}`three` counts the number of entries in a three-entry list:

```anchor three
def three : Nat := Id.run do
  let mut x := 0
  for _ in [1, 2, 3] do
    x := x + 1
  return x
```
Similarly, {anchorName six}`six` adds the entries in a list:

```anchor six
def six : Nat := Id.run do
  let mut x := 0
  for y in [1, 2, 3] do
    x := x + y
  return x
```

{anchorName ListCount}`List.count` counts the number of entries in a list that satisfy some check:

```anchor ListCount
def List.count (p : α → Bool) (xs : List α) : Nat := Id.run do
  let mut found := 0
  for x in xs do
    if p x then found := found + 1
  return found
```

Local mutable variables can be more convenient to use and easier to read than an explicit local use of {anchorName twoStateT}`StateT`.
However, they don't have the full power of unrestricted mutable variables from imperative languages.
In particular, they can only be modified in the {kw}`do`-block in which they are introduced.
This means, for instance, that {kw}`for`-loops can't be replaced by otherwise-equivalent recursive helper functions.
This version of {anchorName nonLocalMut}`List.count`:
```anchor nonLocalMut
def List.count (p : α → Bool) (xs : List α) : Nat := Id.run do
  let mut found := 0
  let rec go : List α → Id Unit
    | [] => pure ()
    | y :: ys => do
      if p y then found := found + 1
      go ys
  return found
```
yields the following error on the attempted mutation of {anchorName nonLocalMut}`found`:
```anchorError nonLocalMut
`found` cannot be mutated, only variables declared using `let mut` can be mutated. If you did not intend to mutate but define `found`, consider using `let found` instead
```
This is because the recursive function is written in the identity monad, and only the monad of the {kw}`do`-block in which the variable is introduced is transformed with {anchorName twoStateT}`StateT`.

# What counts as a {kw}`do` block?

Many features of {kw}`do`-notation apply only to a single {kw}`do`-block.
Early return terminates the current block, and mutable variables can only be mutated in the block that they are defined in.
To use them effectively, it's important to know what counts as “the same block”.

Generally speaking, the indented block following the {kw}`do` keyword counts as a block, and the immediate sequence of statements underneath it are part of that block.
Statements in independent blocks that are nonetheless contained in a block are not considered part of the block.
However, the rules that govern what exactly counts as the same block are slightly subtle, so some examples are in order.
The precise nature of the rules can be tested by setting up a program with a mutable variable and seeing where the mutation is allowed.
This program has a mutation that is clearly in the same block as the mutable variable:

```anchor sameBlock
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  x := x + 1
```

When a mutation occurs in a {kw}`do`-block that is part of a {kw}`let`-statement that defines a name using {lit}`:=`, then it is not considered to be part of the block:
```anchor letBodyNotBlock
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  let other := do
    x := x + 1
  other
```
```anchorError letBodyNotBlock
`x` cannot be mutated, only variables declared using `let mut` can be mutated. If you did not intend to mutate but define `x`, consider using `let x` instead
```
However, a {kw}`do`-block that occurs under a {kw}`let`-statement that defines a name using {lit}`←` is considered part of the surrounding block.
The following program is accepted:

```anchor letBodyArrBlock
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  let other ← do
    x := x + 1
  pure other
```

Similarly, {kw}`do`-blocks that occur as arguments to functions are independent of their surrounding blocks.
The following program is not accepted:
```anchor funArgNotBlock
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  let addFour (y : Id Nat) := Id.run y + 4
  addFour do
    x := 5
```
```anchorError funArgNotBlock
`x` cannot be mutated, only variables declared using `let mut` can be mutated. If you did not intend to mutate but define `x`, consider using `let x` instead
```

If the {kw}`do` keyword is completely redundant, then it does not introduce a new block.
This program is accepted, and is equivalent to the first one in this section:

```anchor collapsedBlock
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  do x := x + 1
```

The contents of branches under a {kw}`do` (such as those introduced by {kw}`match` or {kw}`if`) are considered to be part of the surrounding block, whether or not a redundant {kw}`do` is added.
The following programs are all accepted:

```anchor ifDoSame
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  if x > 2 then
    x := x + 1
```

```anchor ifDoDoSame
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  if x > 2 then do
    x := x + 1
```

```anchor matchDoSame
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  match true with
  | true => x := x + 1
  | false => x := 17
```

```anchor matchDoDoSame
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  match true with
  | true => do
    x := x + 1
  | false => do
    x := 17
```
Similarly, the {kw}`do` that occurs as part of the {kw}`for` and {kw}`unless` syntax is just part of their syntax, and does not introduce a fresh {kw}`do`-block.
These programs are also accepted:

```anchor doForSame
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  for y in [1:5] do
   x := x + y
```

```anchor doUnlessSame
example : Id Unit := do
  let mut x := 0
  unless 1 < 5 do
    x := x + 1
```


# Imperative or Functional Programming?

The imperative features provided by Lean's {kw}`do`-notation allow many programs to very closely resemble their counterparts in languages like Rust, Java, or C#.
This resemblance is very convenient when translating an imperative algorithm into Lean, and some tasks are just most naturally thought of imperatively.
The introduction of monads and monad transformers enables imperative programs to be written in purely functional languages, and {kw}`do`-notation as a specialized syntax for monads (potentially locally transformed) allows functional programmers to have the best of both worlds: the strong reasoning principles afforded by immutability and a tight control over available effects through the type system are combined with syntax and libraries that allow programs that use effects to look familiar and be easy to read.
Monads and monad transformers allow functional versus imperative programming to be a matter of perspective.


# Exercises

 * Rewrite {lit}`doug` to use {kw}`for` instead of the {anchorName doList (module:=DirTree)}`doList` function.
 * Are there other opportunities to use the features introduced in this section to improve the code? If so, use them!
