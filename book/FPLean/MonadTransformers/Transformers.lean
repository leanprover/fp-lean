#doc (Manual) "A Monad Construction Kit" =>

{anchorName m}`ReaderT` is far from the only useful monad transformer.
This section describes a number of additional transformers.
Each monad transformer consists of the following:
 1. A definition or datatype {anchorName general}`T` that takes a monad as an argument.
    It should have a type like {anchorTerm general}`(Type u → Type v) → Type u → Type v`, though it may accept additional arguments prior to the monad.
 2. A {anchorName general}`Monad` instance for {anchorTerm general}`T m` that relies on an instance of {anchorTerm general}`Monad m`. This enables the transformed monad to be used as a monad.
 3. A {anchorName general}`MonadLift` instance that translates actions of type {anchorTerm general}`m α` into actions of type {anchorTerm general}`T m α`, for arbitrary monads {anchorName general}`m`. This enables actions from the underlying monad to be used in the transformed monad.

Furthermore, the {anchorName general}`Monad` instance for the transformer should obey the contract for {anchorName general}`Monad`, at least if the underlying {anchorName general}`Monad` instance does.
In addition, {anchorTerm general}`monadLift (pure x : m α)` should be equivalent to {anchorTerm general}`pure x` in the transformed monad, and {anchorName general}`monadLift` should distribute over {anchorName MonadStateT}`bind` so that {anchorTerm general}`monadLift (x >>= f : m α)` is the same as {anchorTerm general}`(monadLift x : m α) >>= fun y => monadLift (f y)`.

Many monad transformers additionally define type classes in the style of {anchorName m}`MonadReader` that describe the actual effects available in the monad.
This can provide more flexibility: it allows programs to be written that rely only on an interface, and don't constrain the underlying monad to be implemented by a given transformer.
The type classes are a way for programs to express their requirements, and monad transformers are a convenient way to meet these requirements.


# Failure with {lit}`OptionT`

Failure, represented by the {anchorName OptionExcept}`Option` monad, and exceptions, represented by the {anchorName M1eval}`Except` monad, both have corresponding transformers.
In the case of {anchorName OptionTdef}`Option`, failure can be added to a monad by having it contain values of type {anchorTerm OptionTdef}`Option α` where it would otherwise contain values of type {anchorName OptionTdef}`α`.
For example, {anchorTerm m}`IO (Option α)` represents {anchorName m}`IO` actions that don't always return a value of type {anchorName m}`α`.
This suggests the definition of the monad transformer {anchorName OptionTdef}`OptionT`:

```anchor OptionTdef
def OptionT (m : Type u → Type v) (α : Type u) : Type v :=
  m (Option α)
```

As an example of {anchorName OptionTdef}`OptionT` in action, consider a program that asks the user questions.
The function {anchorName getSomeInput}`getSomeInput` asks for a line of input and removes whitespace from both ends.
If the resulting trimmed input is non-empty, then it is returned, but the function fails if there are no non-whitespace characters:

```anchor getSomeInput
def getSomeInput : OptionT IO String := do
  let input ← (← IO.getStdin).getLine
  let trimmed := input.trim
  if trimmed == "" then
    failure
  else pure trimmed
```
This particular application tracks users with their name and their favorite species of beetle:

```anchor UserInfo
structure UserInfo where
  name : String
  favoriteBeetle : String
```
Asking the user for input is no more verbose than a function that uses only {anchorName m}`IO` would be:

```anchor getUserInfo
def getUserInfo : OptionT IO UserInfo := do
  IO.println "What is your name?"
  let name ← getSomeInput
  IO.println "What is your favorite species of beetle?"
  let beetle ← getSomeInput
  pure ⟨name, beetle⟩
```
However, because the function runs in an {anchorTerm getSomeInput}`OptionT IO` context rather than just in {anchorName m}`IO`, failure in the first call to {anchorName getSomeInput}`getSomeInput` causes the whole {anchorName getUserInfo}`getUserInfo` to fail, with control never reaching the question about beetles.
The main function, {anchorName interact}`interact`, invokes {anchorName interact}`getUserInfo` in a purely {anchorName m}`IO` context, which allows it to check whether the call succeeded or failed by matching on the inner {anchorName m}`Option`:

```anchor interact
def interact : IO Unit := do
  match ← getUserInfo with
  | none =>
    IO.eprintln "Missing info"
  | some ⟨name, beetle⟩ =>
    IO.println s!"Hello {name}, whose favorite beetle is {beetle}."
```

## The Monad Instance

Writing the monad instance reveals a difficulty.
Based on the types, {anchorName MonadExceptT}`pure` should use {anchorName MonadMissingUni}`pure` from the underlying monad {anchorName firstMonadOptionT}`m` together with {anchorName firstMonadOptionT}`some`.
Just as {anchorName firstMonadOptionT}`bind` for {anchorName m}`Option` branches on the first argument, propagating {anchorName firstMonadOptionT}`none`, {anchorName firstMonadOptionT}`bind` for {anchorName firstMonadOptionT}`OptionT` should run the monadic action that makes up the first argument, branch on the result, and then propagate {anchorName firstMonadOptionT}`none`.
Following this sketch yields the following definition, which Lean does not accept:
```anchor firstMonadOptionT
instance [Monad m] : Monad (OptionT m) where
  pure x := pure (some x)
  bind action next := do
    match (← action) with
    | none => pure none
    | some v => next v
```
The error message shows a cryptic type mismatch:
```anchorError firstMonadOptionT
Application type mismatch: In the application
  pure (some x)
the argument
  some x
has type
  Option α✝ : Type ?u.78
but is expected to have type
  α✝ : Type ?u.78
```
The problem here is that Lean is selecting the wrong {anchorName firstMonadOptionT}`Monad` instance for the surrounding use of {anchorName firstMonadOptionT}`pure`.
Similar errors occur for the definition of {anchorName firstMonadOptionT}`bind`.
One solution is to use type annotations to guide Lean to the correct {anchorName MonadOptionTAnnots}`Monad` instance:

```anchor MonadOptionTAnnots
instance [Monad m] : Monad (OptionT m) where
  pure x := (pure (some x) : m (Option _))
  bind action next := (do
    match (← action) with
    | none => pure none
    | some v => next v : m (Option _))
```
While this solution works, it is inelegant and the code becomes a bit noisy.

An alternative solution is to define functions whose type signatures guide Lean to the correct instances.
In fact, {anchorName OptionTStructure}`OptionT` could have been defined as a structure:

```anchor OptionTStructure
structure OptionT (m : Type u → Type v) (α : Type u) : Type v where
  run : m (Option α)
```
This would solve the problem, because the constructor {anchorName OptionTStructuredefs}`OptionT.mk` and the field accessor {anchorName OptionTStructuredefs}`OptionT.run` would guide type class inference to the correct instances.
The downside to doing this is that the resulting code is more complicated, and these structures can make it more difficult to read proofs.
The best of both worlds can be achieved by defining functions that serve the same role as the constructor {anchorName OptionTStructuredefs}`OptionT.mk` and the field {anchorName OptionTStructuredefs}`OptionT.run`, but that work with the direct definition:

```anchor FakeStructOptionT
def OptionT.mk (x : m (Option α)) : OptionT m α := x

def OptionT.run (x : OptionT m α) : m (Option α) := x
```
Both functions return their inputs unchanged, but they indicate the boundary between code that is intended to present the interface of {anchorName FakeStructOptionT}`OptionT` and code that is intended to present the interface of the underlying monad {anchorName FakeStructOptionT}`m`.
Using these helpers, the {anchorName MonadOptionTFakeStruct}`Monad` instance becomes more readable:

```anchor MonadOptionTFakeStruct
instance [Monad m] : Monad (OptionT m) where
  pure x := OptionT.mk (pure (some x))
  bind action next := OptionT.mk do
    match ← action with
    | none => pure none
    | some v => next v
```
Here, the use of {anchorName FakeStructOptionT}`OptionT.mk` indicates that its arguments should be considered as code that uses the interface of {anchorName MonadOptionTFakeStruct}`m`, which allows Lean to select the correct {anchorName MonadOptionTFakeStruct}`Monad` instances.

After defining the monad instance, it's a good idea to check that the monad contract is satisfied.
The first step is to show that {anchorTerm OptionTFirstLaw}`bind (pure v) f` is the same as {anchorTerm OptionTFirstLaw}`f v`.
Here's the steps:

```anchorEqSteps OptionTFirstLaw
bind (pure v) f
={ /-- Unfolding the definitions of `bind` and `pure` -/
   by simp [bind, pure, OptionT.mk]
}=
OptionT.mk do
  match ← pure (some v) with
  | none => pure none
  | some x => f x
={
/-- Desugaring nested action syntax -/
}=
OptionT.mk do
  let y ← pure (some v)
  match y with
  | none => pure none
  | some x => f x
={
/-- Desugaring `do`-notation -/
}=
OptionT.mk
  (pure (some v) >>= fun y =>
    match y with
    | none => pure none
    | some x => f x)
={
  /-- Using the first monad rule for `m` -/
  by simp [LawfulMonad.pure_bind (m := m)]
}=
OptionT.mk
  (match some v with
   | none => pure none
   | some x => f x)
={
/-- Reduce `match` -/
}=
OptionT.mk (f v)
={
/-- Definition of `OptionT.mk` -/
}=
f v
```

The second rule states that {anchorTerm OptionTSecondLaw}`bind w pure` is the same as {anchorName OptionTSecondLaw}`w`.
To demonstrate this, unfold the definitions of {anchorName OptionTSecondLaw}`bind` and {anchorName OptionTSecondLaw}`pure`, yielding:
```anchorTerm OptionTSecondLaw
OptionT.mk do
    match ← w with
    | none => pure none
    | some v => pure (some v)
```
In this pattern match, the result of both cases is the same as the pattern being matched, just with {anchorName OptionTSecondLaw}`pure` around it.
In other words, it is equivalent to {anchorTerm OptionTSecondLaw}`w >>= fun y => pure y`, which is an instance of {anchorName OptionTFirstLaw}`m`'s second monad rule.

The final rule states that {anchorTerm OptionTThirdLaw}`bind (bind v f) g`  is the same as {anchorTerm OptionTThirdLaw}`bind v (fun x => bind (f x) g)`.
It can be checked in the same way, by expanding the definitions of {anchorName OptionTThirdLaw}`bind` and {anchorName OptionTSecondLaw}`pure` and then delegating to the underlying monad {anchorName OptionTFirstLaw}`m`.

## An {lit}`Alternative` Instance

One convenient way to use {anchorName OptionTdef}`OptionT` is through the {anchorName AlternativeOptionT}`Alternative` type class.
Successful return is already indicated by {anchorName AlternativeOptionT}`pure`, and the {anchorName AlternativeOptionT}`failure` and {anchorName AlternativeOptionT}`orElse` methods of {anchorName AlternativeOptionT}`Alternative` provide a way to write a program that returns the first successful result from a number of subprograms:

```anchor AlternativeOptionT
instance [Monad m] : Alternative (OptionT m) where
  failure := OptionT.mk (pure none)
  orElse x y := OptionT.mk do
    match ← x with
    | some result => pure (some result)
    | none => y ()
```


## Lifting

Lifting an action from {anchorName LiftOptionT}`m` to {anchorTerm LiftOptionT}`OptionT m` only requires wrapping {anchorName LiftOptionT}`some` around the result of the computation:

```anchor LiftOptionT
instance [Monad m] : MonadLift m (OptionT m) where
  monadLift action := OptionT.mk do
    pure (some (← action))
```


# Exceptions

The monad transformer version of {anchorName ExceptT}`Except` is very similar to the monad transformer version of {anchorName m}`Option`.
Adding exceptions of type {anchorName ExceptT}`ε` to some monadic action of type {anchorTerm ExceptT}`m`{lit}` `{anchorTerm ExceptT}`α` can be accomplished by adding exceptions to {anchorName MonadExcept}`α`, yielding type {anchorTerm ExceptT}`m (Except ε α)`:

```anchor ExceptT
def ExceptT (ε : Type u) (m : Type u → Type v) (α : Type u) : Type v :=
  m (Except ε α)
```
{anchorName OptionTdef}`OptionT` provides {anchorName FakeStructOptionT}`OptionT.mk` and {anchorName FakeStructOptionT}`OptionT.run` functions to guide the type checker towards the correct {anchorName MonadOptionTFakeStruct}`Monad` instances.
This trick is also useful for {anchorName ExceptTFakeStruct}`ExceptT`:

```anchor ExceptTFakeStruct
  def ExceptT.mk {ε α : Type u} (x : m (Except ε α)) : ExceptT ε m α := x

  def ExceptT.run {ε α : Type u} (x : ExceptT ε m α) : m (Except ε α) := x
```
The {anchorName MonadExceptT}`Monad` instance for {anchorName MonadExceptT}`ExceptT` is also very similar to the instance for {anchorName MonadOptionTFakeStruct}`OptionT`.
The only difference is that it propagates a specific error value, rather than {anchorName MonadOptionTFakeStruct}`none`:

```anchor MonadExceptT
instance {ε : Type u} {m : Type u → Type v} [Monad m] :
    Monad (ExceptT ε m) where
  pure x := ExceptT.mk (pure (Except.ok x))
  bind result next := ExceptT.mk do
    match ← result with
    | .error e => pure (.error e)
    | .ok x => next x
```

The type signatures of {anchorName ExceptTFakeStruct}`ExceptT.mk` and {anchorName ExceptTFakeStruct}`ExceptT.run` contain a subtle detail: they annotate the universe levels of {anchorName ExceptTFakeStruct}`α` and {anchorName ExceptTFakeStruct}`ε` explicitly.
If they are not explicitly annotated, then Lean generates a more general type signature in which they have distinct polymorphic universe variables.
However, the definition of {anchorName ExceptTFakeStruct}`ExceptT` expects them to be in the same universe, because they can both be provided as arguments to {anchorName ExceptTFakeStruct}`m`.
This can lead to a problem in the {anchorName MonadStateT}`Monad` instance where the universe level solver fails to find a working solution:

```anchor ExceptTNoUnis
def ExceptT.mk (x : m (Except ε α)) : ExceptT ε m α := x
```
```anchor MonadMissingUni
instance {ε : Type u} {m : Type u → Type v} [Monad m] :
    Monad (ExceptT ε m) where
  pure x := ExceptT.mk (pure (Except.ok x))
  bind result next := ExceptT.mk do
    match (← result) with
    | .error e => pure (.error e)
    | .ok x => next x
```
```anchorError MonadMissingUni
stuck at solving universe constraint
  max ?u.10439 ?u.10440 =?= u
while trying to unify
  ExceptT ε m β✝ : Type v
with
  ExceptT.{max ?u.10440 ?u.10439, v} ε m β✝ : Type v
```
This kind of error message is typically caused by underconstrained universe variables.
Diagnosing it can be tricky, but a good first step is to look for reused universe variables in some definitions that are not reused in others.

Unlike {anchorName m}`Option`, the {anchorName m}`Except` datatype is typically not used as a data structure.
It is always used as a control structure with its {anchorName MonadExceptT}`Monad` instance.
This means that it is reasonable to lift {anchorTerm ExceptTLiftExcept}`Except ε` actions into {anchorTerm ExceptTLiftExcept}`ExceptT ε m`, as well as actions from the underlying monad {anchorName ExceptTLiftExcept}`m`.
Lifting {anchorName ExceptTLiftExcept}`Except` actions into {anchorName ExceptTLiftExcept}`ExceptT` actions is done by wrapping them in {anchorName ExceptTLiftExcept}`m`'s {anchorName ExceptTLiftExcept}`pure`, because an action that only has exception effects cannot have any effects from the monad {anchorName ExceptTLiftExcept}`m`:

```anchor ExceptTLiftExcept
instance [Monad m] : MonadLift (Except ε) (ExceptT ε m) where
  monadLift action := ExceptT.mk (pure action)
```
Because actions from {anchorName ExceptTLiftExcept}`m` do not have any exceptions in them, their value should be wrapped in {anchorName MonadExceptT}`Except.ok`.
This can be accomplished using the fact that {anchorName various}`Functor` is a superclass of {anchorName various}`Monad`, so applying a function to the result of any monadic computation can be accomplished using {anchorName various}`Functor.map`:

```anchor ExceptTLiftM
instance [Monad m] : MonadLift m (ExceptT ε m) where
  monadLift action := ExceptT.mk (.ok <$> action)
```

## Type Classes for Exceptions

Exception handling fundamentally consists of two operations: the ability to throw exceptions, and the ability to recover from them.
Thus far, this has been accomplished using the constructors of {anchorName m}`Except` and pattern matching, respectively.
However, this ties a program that uses exceptions to one specific encoding of the exception handling effect.
Using a type class to capture these operations allows a program that uses exceptions to be used in _any_ monad that supports throwing and catching.

Throwing an exception should take an exception as an argument, and it should be allowed in any context where a monadic action is requested.
The “any context” part of the specification can be written as a type by writing {anchorTerm MonadExcept}`m α`—because there's no way to produce a value of any arbitrary type, the {anchorName MonadExcept}`throw` operation must be doing something that causes control to leave that part of the program.
Catching an exception should accept any monadic action together with a handler, and the handler should explain how to get back to the action's type from an exception:

```anchor MonadExcept
class MonadExcept (ε : outParam (Type u)) (m : Type v → Type w) where
  throw : ε → m α
  tryCatch : m α → (ε → m α) → m α
```

The universe levels on {anchorName MonadExcept}`MonadExcept` differ from those of {anchorName ExceptT}`ExceptT`.
In {anchorName ExceptT}`ExceptT`, both {anchorName ExceptT}`ε` and {anchorName ExceptT}`α` have the same level, while {anchorName MonadExcept}`MonadExcept` imposes no such limitation.
This is because {anchorName MonadExcept}`MonadExcept` never places an exception value inside of {anchorName MonadExcept}`m`.
The most general universe signature recognizes the fact that {anchorName MonadExcept}`ε` and {anchorName MonadExcept}`α` are completely independent in this definition.
Being more general means that the type class can be instantiated for a wider variety of types.

An example program that uses {anchorName MonadExcept}`MonadExcept` is a simple division service.
The program is divided into two parts: a frontend that supplies a user interface based on strings that handles errors, and a backend that actually does the division.
Both the frontend and the backend can throw exceptions, the former for ill-formed input and the latter for division by zero errors.
The exceptions are an inductive type:

```anchor ErrEx
inductive Err where
  | divByZero
  | notANumber : String → Err
```
The backend checks for zero, and divides if it can:

```anchor divBackend
def divBackend [Monad m] [MonadExcept Err m] (n k : Int) : m Int :=
  if k == 0 then
    throw .divByZero
  else pure (n / k)
```
The frontend's helper {anchorName asNumber}`asNumber` throws an exception if the string it is passed is not a number.
The overall frontend converts its inputs to {anchorName asNumber}`Int`s and calls the backend, handling exceptions by returning a friendly string error:

```anchor asNumber
def asNumber [Monad m] [MonadExcept Err m] (s : String) : m Int :=
  match s.toInt? with
  | none => throw (.notANumber s)
  | some i => pure i
```

```anchor divFrontend
def divFrontend [Monad m] [MonadExcept Err m] (n k : String) : m String :=
  tryCatch (do pure (toString (← divBackend (← asNumber n) (← asNumber k))))
    fun
      | .divByZero => pure "Division by zero!"
      | .notANumber s => pure s!"Not a number: \"{s}\""
```
Throwing and catching exceptions is common enough that Lean provides a special syntax for using {anchorName divFrontendSugary}`MonadExcept`.
Just as {lit}`+` is short for {anchorName various}`HAdd.hAdd`, {kw}`try` and {kw}`catch` can be used as shorthand for the {anchorName MonadExcept}`tryCatch` method:

```anchor divFrontendSugary
def divFrontend [Monad m] [MonadExcept Err m] (n k : String) : m String :=
  try
    pure (toString (← divBackend (← asNumber n) (← asNumber k)))
  catch
    | .divByZero => pure "Division by zero!"
    | .notANumber s => pure s!"Not a number: \"{s}\""
```

In addition to {anchorName m}`Except` and {anchorName ExceptT}`ExceptT`, there are useful {anchorName MonadExcept}`MonadExcept` instances for other types that may not seem like exceptions at first glance.
For example, failure due to {anchorName m}`Option` can be seen as throwing an exception that contains no data whatsoever, so there is an instance of {anchorTerm OptionExcept}`MonadExcept Unit Option` that allows {kw}`try`{lit}` ...`{kw}`catch`{lit}` ...` syntax to be used with {anchorName m}`Option`.

# State

A simulation of mutable state is added to a monad by having monadic actions accept a starting state as an argument and return a final state together with their result.
The bind operator for a state monad provides the final state of one action as an argument to the next action, threading the state through the program.
This pattern can also be expressed as a monad transformer:

```anchor DefStateT
def StateT (σ : Type u)
    (m : Type u → Type v) (α : Type u) : Type (max u v) :=
  σ → m (α × σ)
```


Once again, the monad instance is very similar to that for {anchorName State (module := Examples.Monads)}`State`.
The only difference is that the input and output states are passed around and returned in the underlying monad, rather than with pure code:

```anchor MonadStateT
instance [Monad m] : Monad (StateT σ m) where
  pure x := fun s => pure (x, s)
  bind result next := fun s => do
    let (v, s') ← result s
    next v s'
```

The corresponding type class has {anchorName MonadState}`get` and {anchorName MonadState}`set` methods.
One downside of {anchorName MonadState}`get` and {anchorName MonadState}`set` is that it becomes too easy to {anchorName MonadState}`set` the wrong state when updating it.
This is because retrieving the state, updating it, and saving the updated state is a natural way to write some programs.
For example, the following program counts the number of diacritic-free English vowels and consonants in a string of letters:

```anchor countLetters
structure LetterCounts where
  vowels : Nat
  consonants : Nat
deriving Repr

inductive Err where
  | notALetter : Char → Err
deriving Repr

def vowels :=
  let lowerVowels := "aeiuoy"
  lowerVowels ++ lowerVowels.map (·.toUpper)

def consonants :=
  let lowerConsonants := "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz"
  lowerConsonants ++ lowerConsonants.map (·.toUpper )

def countLetters (str : String) : StateT LetterCounts (Except Err) Unit :=
  let rec loop (chars : List Char) := do
    match chars with
    | [] => pure ()
    | c :: cs =>
      let st ← get
      let st' ←
        if c.isAlpha then
          if vowels.contains c then
            pure {st with vowels := st.vowels + 1}
          else if consonants.contains c then
            pure {st with consonants := st.consonants + 1}
          else -- modified or non-English letter
            pure st
        else throw (.notALetter c)
      set st'
      loop cs
  loop str.toList
```
It would be very easy to write {lit}`set st` instead of {anchorTerm countLetters}`set st'`.
In a large program, this kind of mistake can lead to difficult-to-diagnose bugs.

While using a nested action for the call to {anchorName countLetters}`get` would solve this problem, it can't solve all such problems.
For example, a function might update a field on a structure based on the values of two other fields.
This would require two separate nested-action calls to {anchorName countLetters}`get`.
Because the Lean compiler contains optimizations that are only effective when there is a single reference to a value, duplicating the references to the state might lead to code that is significantly slower.
Both the potential performance problem and the potential bug can be worked around by using {anchorName countLettersModify}`modify`, which transforms the state using a function:

```anchor countLettersModify
def countLetters (str : String) : StateT LetterCounts (Except Err) Unit :=
  let rec loop (chars : List Char) := do
    match chars with
    | [] => pure ()
    | c :: cs =>
      if c.isAlpha then
        if vowels.contains c then
          modify fun st => {st with vowels := st.vowels + 1}
        else if consonants.contains c then
          modify fun st => {st with consonants := st.consonants + 1}
        else -- modified or non-English letter
          pure ()
      else throw (.notALetter c)
      loop cs
  loop str.toList
```
The type class contains a function akin to {anchorName modify}`modify` called {anchorName modify}`modifyGet`, which allows the function to both compute a return value and transform an old state in a single step.
The function returns a pair in which the first element is the return value, and the second element is the new state; {anchorName modify}`modify` just adds the constructor of {anchorName modify}`Unit` to the pair used in {anchorName modify}`modifyGet`:

```anchor modify
def modify [MonadState σ m] (f : σ → σ) : m Unit :=
  modifyGet fun s => ((), f s)
```

The definition of {anchorName MonadState}`MonadState` is as follows:

```anchor MonadState
class MonadState (σ : outParam (Type u)) (m : Type u → Type v) :
    Type (max (u+1) v) where
  get : m σ
  set : σ → m PUnit
  modifyGet : (σ → α × σ) → m α
```
{anchorName MonadState}`PUnit` is a version of the {anchorName modify}`Unit` type that is universe-polymorphic to allow it to be in {anchorTerm MonadState}`Type u` instead of {anchorTerm MonadState}`Type`.
While it would be possible to provide a default implementation of {anchorName MonadState}`modifyGet` in terms of {anchorName MonadState}`get` and {anchorName MonadState}`set`, it would not admit the optimizations that make {anchorName MonadState}`modifyGet` useful in the first place, rendering the method useless.

# {lit}`Of` Classes and {lit}`The` Functions

Thus far, each monad type class that takes extra information, like the type of exceptions for {anchorName MonadExcept}`MonadExcept` or the type of the state for {anchorName MonadState}`MonadState`, has this type of extra information as an output parameter.
For simple programs, this is generally convenient, because a monad that combines one use each of {anchorName MonadStateT}`StateT`, {anchorName m}`ReaderT`, and {anchorName ExceptT}`ExceptT` has only a single state type, environment type, and exception type.
As monads grow in complexity, however, they may involve multiple states or errors types.
In this case, the use of an output parameter makes it impossible to target both states in the same {kw}`do`-block.

For these cases, there are additional type classes in which the extra information is not an output parameter.
These versions of the type classes use the word {lit}`Of` in the name.
For example, {anchorName getTheType}`MonadStateOf` is like {anchorName MonadState}`MonadState`, but without an {anchorName MonadState}`outParam` modifier.

Instead of an {anchorName MonadState}`outParam`, these classes use a {anchorName various}`semiOutParam` for their respective state, environment, or exception types.
Like an {anchorName MonadState}`outParam`, a {anchorName various}`semiOutParam` is not required be known before Lean begins the process of searching for an instance.
However, there is an important difference: {anchorName MonadState}`outParam`s are ignored during the search for an instance, and as a result they are truly outputs.
If an {anchorName MonadState}`outParam` is known prior to the search, then Lean merely checks that the result of the search is the same as what was known.
On the other hand, a {anchorName various}`semiOutParam` that is known prior to the start of the search can be used to narrow down candidates, just like an input parameter.

When a state monad's state type is an {anchorName MonadState}`outParam`, then each monad can have at most one type of state.
This is convenient, because it improves type inference: the state type can be inferred in more circumstances.
This is also inconvenient, because a monad built from multiple uses of {anchorName countLetters}`StateT` cannot provide a useful {anchorName modify}`MonadState` instance.
Using {anchorName modifyTheType}`MonadStateOf`, however, causes Lean to take the state type into account when it is available to select which instance to use, so one monad may provide multiple types of state.
The downside of this is that the resulting instance may not be the one that was intended when the state type has not been specified explicitly enough, which can lead to confusing error messages.

Similarly, there are versions of the type class methods that accept the type of the extra information as an _explicit_, rather than implicit, argument.
For {anchorName modifyTheType}`MonadStateOf`, there are {anchorTerm getTheType}`getThe` with type
```anchorTerm getTheType
(σ : Type u) → {m : Type u → Type v} → [MonadStateOf σ m] → m σ
```
and {anchorTerm modifyTheType}`modifyThe` with type
```anchorTerm modifyTheType
(σ : Type u) → {m : Type u → Type v} → [MonadStateOf σ m] → (σ → σ) → m PUnit
```
There is no {lit}`setThe` because the type of the new state is enough to decide which surrounding state monad transformer to use.

In the Lean standard library, there are instances of the non-{lit}`Of` versions of the classes defined in terms of the instances of the versions with {lit}`Of`.
In other words, implementing the {lit}`Of` version yields implementations of both.
It's generally a good idea to implement the {lit}`Of` version, and then start writing programs using the non-{lit}`Of` versions of the class, transitioning to the {lit}`Of` version if the output parameter becomes inconvenient.

# Transformers and {lit}`Id`

The identity monad {anchorName various}`Id` is the monad that has no effects whatsoever, to be used in contexts that expect a monad for some reason but where none is actually necessary.
Another use of {anchorName various}`Id` is to serve as the bottom of a stack of monad transformers.
For instance, {anchorTerm StateTDoubleB}`StateT σ Id` works just like {anchorTerm set (module:=Examples.Monads)}`State σ`.


# Exercises

## Monad Contract

Using pencil and paper, check that the rules of the monad transformer contract are satisfied for each monad transformer in this section.

## Logging Transformer

Define a monad transformer version of {anchorName WithLog (module:=Examples.Monads)}`WithLog`.
Also define the corresponding type class {lit}`MonadWithLog`, and write a program that combines logging and exceptions.

## Counting Files

Modify {lit}`doug`'s monad with {anchorName MonadStateT}`StateT` such that it counts the number of directories and files seen.
At the end of execution, it should display a report like:
```
  Viewed 38 files in 5 directories.
```
